# ComfyUI YouFunnyGuys Comical Custom Nodes

This is a repository of ComfyUI custom nodes. I was looking for a node that provided some functionality and did not find one. So I decided to create one myself in order to have the functionality I desired as well as way to teach myself how to code.

## Acknowledgements

I have to give credit to at least those who's other custom nodes I use quite often and in some cases make my life in ComfyUI all around better.

This node allows you to take an input image, calculate it's histogram for the color channels as well as the L channel and display a graphical representation of the data.

### Meme Generator

OK there are probably 5 or 10 nodes already that do this and do it really well. I made one as I was learning to go beyond "Hello World" 

### Hello World

Obviously this is where everyone starts, right? RIGHT? :roll_eyes:

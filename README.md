# YFG Comical ComfyUI Custom Nodes 

</div>

A collection of ComfyUI utility custom nodes. Hope these provide some functionality nopt offered in the core app or other custom nodes.

## Nodes

### Image Histograms Generator

![Image Historgrams Generator](img/imagehistogramsgenerator.png)

This node allows you to take an input image, calculate its histogram for the color channels as well as the L channel and display a graphical representation of the data.

## Examples

### Sample Workflow

![Example Workflow](workflows/ComfyUI_YFG_Comical-Example-Workflow.png)

The workflow should be embedded in the file. If you can't get it to load, feel free to download and open the [workflow.json](workflows/ComfyUI_YFG_Comical-Example-Workflow.json) file.

## Acknowledgements

I have to give credit to at least those who's other custom nodes I use quite often and in some cases make my life in ComfyUI all around better.
